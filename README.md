# 🏠 HomeMatch – Personalized Real Estate Experience

## 📌 Project Summary

**HomeMatch** is a next-generation real estate application that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases to create personalized property listings. By analyzing buyer preferences given in natural language, the app delivers tailored descriptions of properties that match the buyer’s unique needs and lifestyle.

---

## 🚀 Objective

Build a Python-based application that:
- Accepts buyer preferences in natural language.
- Searches a vector database of real estate listings.
- Uses an LLM to rewrite listing descriptions personalized to each user.
- Displays tailored listings that resonate with individual preferences.

---

## 🧩 Components Overview

### 1. Collect Buyer Preferences
Buyers provide inputs about:
- Location
- Budget
- Desired amenities
- Lifestyle factors
- Property size and type

### 2. Vector Database
Use **ChromaDB** or **LanceDB** to:
- Store semantically embedded real estate listings.
- Enable fast semantic similarity search.

### 3. Personalized Listings via LLM
- Use an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT) to rewrite listings.
- Personalize tone, focus, and highlight features.
- Ensure factual correctness is maintained.

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup
- Create a virtual environment.
- Install required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install langchain chromadb openai
  ```

### Step 2: Create Synthetic Listings
- Use an LLM to generate at least **10 property listings**.
- Each listing should include:
  - Price
  - Location
  - Bedrooms/Bathrooms
  - Description
  - Neighborhood overview

### Step 3: Embed and Store Listings
- Convert each listing to an embedding.
- Store in the vector DB for similarity search.

### Step 4: Define Buyer Profile Interface
- Collect inputs like:
  ```python
  questions = [   
      "How big do you want your house to be?",
      "What are 3 most important things for you in choosing this property?",
      "Which amenities would you like?",
      "Which transportation options are important to you?",
      "How urban do you want your neighborhood to be?",   
  ]
  ```

### Step 5: Search for Relevant Listings
- Convert buyer preferences into an embedding.
- Query the vector DB for the top relevant listings.

### Step 6: Generate Personalized Descriptions
- Use an LLM to:
  - Rewrite the listing description.
  - Focus on buyer-specified interests and preferences.

### Step 7: Test with Multiple Profiles
- Test output for various buyer types.
- Validate clarity, personalization, and relevance.
